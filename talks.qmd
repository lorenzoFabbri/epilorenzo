This page contains links and materials for various workshops, talks, lectures, and presentations I've given. Research presentations at conferences are typically stored in their respective repositories on GitHub. One-off workshops and talks can be found in a [catch-all GitHub repository](https://github.com/lorenzoFabbri/talks).
